/**
 A ILHash (or just hash) is a facet implementing an hashtable for generic pointer-sized values. The hash stores a number of pointer-sized items (called 'values'), and allows you to retrieve them, test their containment by the hashtable, and remove them if present; it also allows you to use a different pointer-sized value (called a 'key') to retrieve and perform editing on a value already inserted in the hash.
 
 The hash does not dereference the value and key pointers itself; it relies on manipulation functions you provide. Additionally, the hash only stores value pointers; you are expected to provide and/or store the key pointers yourself (perhaps as part of the value's pointed-to memory location).
 
 The hash requires the hash for a value to remain constant over time for the result of all its addition, testing and removal methods to conform to the given contracts. However, it guarantees that the #getAllValues() method will always perform correctly even in the face of hash changes.
